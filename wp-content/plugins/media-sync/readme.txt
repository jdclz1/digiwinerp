Simple plugin to scan "uploads" directory and bring those files into Media Library.

== Description ==

You can scan all files that are in "uploads" directory and see which ones are actually in Media Library and which ones are just sitting there. Then you can select those that you want to import to database and therefore make them available in Media Library.

You can also use FTP to upload your files to "uploads" directory and use this plugin to bring those files into Media Library. There are other plugins that can be used for that, but with this one you can easily select all and import all at once.


= Why I created this plugin =
I once copied WordPress site to a different server and Media Library ended up being empty, even tho all files were in "uploads" directory and database was copied. So I had to use some other plugin which required me to manually enter each directory and import files in batches per each directory. But I needed something to just import everything at once, so I created this plugin.

Files that are ignored:
- index.php,
- various hidden files,
- WP generated thumbnails - anything ending with for example -100x100.jpg.
This is now configurable with a custom hook function and it can totally overwrite these rules or add additional ones.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `media-sync` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Stuck at importing / spins endlessly
A: Please try to increase `max_execution_time` in `php.ini` on server (as described [here](https://thimpress.com/knowledge-base/how-to-increase-maximum-execution-time-for-wordpress-site/)). Or if you have too many files, try going to Settings -> Media Sync and change "Scan directory" to some inner folder.

Q: Files not showing up in Media Library
A: Please make sure "Dry Run" option is NOT checked. This is a safety mechanism to make sure you know what you're doing, so be careful, try it first with just one file.

Q: Doesn't work
A: Please first try to turn on debugging by adding this: `define('WP_DEBUG', true);` to your `wp-config.php` and check [Network tab in Chrome DevTools](https://www.section.io/blog/chrome-developer-tools-tutorial-network/) to see what is going on in the background. Then report actual errors since it's hard to help without knowing the error which is causing the problem.
